# Artificial Intelligence Project Collection
This repository is filled with academic and personal projects. I wanted to showcase them, but they do not have enough substance to be within their own repositories. I might return to each project at some point to add to or retry them. Some of these projects have also inspired me to create a potentially larger project involving them all.

## nltk-chatbot
For this project I experimented with the NLTK Python library to a rudimentary question and answer chatbot. The purpose of this project was to look at the NLTK and see what I could apply to another major project I'm working on, which is also a chatbot, but one that I want to potentially converse with the user.

## nn-activation-function-tests
This project was an experiment with neural networks. It begun with an object oriented approach, where I had a layer class and a neural network class. I was following a Sebastian Lague video to gain a understanding of neural networks in general. Once I figured that out, I decided it would be the perfect opportunity to learn Google's Jax module. That meant I had to convert my object oriented apporach into a procedural approach, since Jax requires pure-stateless functions to use jit. For the sentiment analysis project I'm working on, I'm hoping to combine the class and procedural approach.

## ride-share-reflex-agent
I was assigned this project for my Intro to AI course. The idea was to create a reflex agent to handle cars for a ride sharing application. The agent's job was to pick up passengers and then drop them off. The agent prioritizes picking up passengers, and when 1 car is assigned multiple pickup or drop-offs, the shortest path is generated using a recursive search. The passengers are assigned based on the closest car to them.
